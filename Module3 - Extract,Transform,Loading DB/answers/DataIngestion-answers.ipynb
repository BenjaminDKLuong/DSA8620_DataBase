    "This passing of content is called web syndication. \n",

      "Hi all. As the title says, I'm interested in multiplayer games that can be played couch co-op or split screen multiplayer. My dad isn't too old (early 50s) but definitely prefers simpler games over complex ones -- we've been playing games on my Switch and he definitely has an easier time with the NES games than something like Diablo 3, which he didn't understand all that much as he had trouble keeping track of different abilities as well as the plot went over his head. He struggled with Snipperclips but enjoyed the Risk demo we played, although he only grasped it because he'd played the board game before. We have Mario Kart but he gets motion sick. Thought of Lego games as I have a handful of those in my Steam library but he's a bit turned off by them as they're a little childish.  I have a Steam Link to stream games from my PC to our television and the aforementioned Switch, as well as an old Wii and a Wii U. Got some nice recommendations on /r/NintendoSwitch (Ultimate Chicken Horse, Overcooked, Puyo Puyo Tetris, Picross S) so I'd be more interested in recommendations for PC but either platform is fine.

Now at this point I'm kinda sweaty, talking spaced out, pupils huge, ya know probably insanely obvious. 5 minutes he's here, I'm a way more wired than I expected. Sitting in the car, he's talking my ear off, and mentions he's spent 26 years as DEA doing undercover work. I took my leftovers with me, cause hey, maybe I might need them? We have a chill conversation, he drops me off 20 minutes later, and I flew through the rest of the day no problem. Just thought it was kinda funny.  /u/raydio27 r/Stims [link] [comments]\n",

      "I have had issues with my Echo 2nd gen detecting the word \"Wesley\" many times, enough I had to change the name of my lights away from \"Wesleys lights\". I have had weird issues with dropins etc. Now I set up voice profiles and when I ask the Alexa app on my phone what my name is, she tells me my name is Wesley. I go down stairs and ask the Echo Dot 2nd gen and she tells me my name is Wesley. I go into my room and ask my Echo 2nd Gen what my name is and she tells me she doesn't know.  Now I have verified the system it's self is working because both on the echo dot and the Alexa app they both are able to understand by voice and tell me what my name is. Yet the Echo in my room only understands for a short time if I unplug the echo and plug back in and start up, THEN it will know who I am for a short time before going back to perpetual failure of knowing me. I waited all night and checked it just now after waking up and she still does not know...  Also when I try and do a callback for support on Amazon the callback fails and it gives me an American phone number instead of a UK one. All settings are set to UK. I actually installed Skype to contact that US number and the guy looked and saw I had put everything on UK for the locations and could not explain it to me.  Now the issue with voice profiles. Does anyone have any info or theories on the problem? I tried deregistering, doing a factory reset etc.  /u/morthawt r/amazonecho [link] [comments]\n",

      "My husband is 24, Im 25. We have been together for 9 years. And even after having our first kid. And having lots of ups and downs and managed to get through them. Our love for eachother has grown soo much. But our sex life has gotten better and better every damn time, the passion and urge to be with and have one another has gotten to the point where we have sex twice a day. I love that he has looked at me the same way after all the years and always tells me that he gets hard just by looking or thinking of me for only 5 seconds. Ever time he gets home from work it’s straight to our room for a good 30-45 minutes before dinner time and while our kid takes a nap. Also before he leave for work. I love how he starts gentle and touches and kisses every inch of my body. After that he fucks me like there is no tomorrow. It has gotten dirtier and dirtier. When he comes home from deployments we always get a hotel room for two days before going to the house because after that we wont have any privacy for a while. We love changing it up, for example with restraints, new positions, doing it at different locations, we have done it in the park once and it was fucking amazing. I also love when Im sleeping and I wake up to him already fucking me. I also do the same for him when i want some in the middle of the night.  After being with him for 9 years and seeing all the people i knew from high school and seeing how majority of them are divorced. Make me soo grateful for having this amazing man in my life. The only one who actually ever loved me for me. Especially at my heaviest. Now i have lost a ton of weight and my husband is enjoying everything that other people said was nasty and gross.  /u/oligar2025 r/sexstoriesxxx [link] [comments]\n"
